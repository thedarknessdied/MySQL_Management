# MySQL_Management
## Introduce
  This project is to make it easier for me to operate the Mysql database during CTF competitions. The recent competitions and practice at the shooting range have made me feel the importance of databases. Some important sensitive information is often stored in the database, but some tools do not have good database connection and operation capabilities, so I wrote a simple PHP project to complete similar tasks.
Up to this stage, the project has only done the most basic content, and will continue to maintain this project in the future.

## Usage
![login](https://github.com/thedarknessdied/MySQL_Management/blob/main/mysql_login.png)
  First you must log in to the system, which requires you to at least know the database IP address, database port and login username (after all, the database name and password can be left blank, right?)
![run](https://github.com/thedarknessdied/MySQL_Management/blob/main/mysql_run_command.png)
  After entering the system, you can click to view the database form or directly execute SQL statements.

## Next Plans
1. Add data backup function
2. Use singleton model to modify page framework
3. Optimize data class objects and change data storage method
