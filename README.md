# MySQL_Management
## Introduce
  This project is to make it easier for me to operate the Mysql database during CTF competitions. The recent competitions and practice at the shooting range have made me feel the importance of databases. Some important sensitive information is often stored in the database, but some tools do not have good database connection and operation capabilities, so I wrote a simple PHP project to complete similar tasks.
Up to this stage, the project has only done the most basic content, and will continue to maintain this project in the future.
